#summary Quick introduction to the code and data.

=Introduction=

Currently there are two sets of code and one data set available.

==Code==

Available in the 'Source' section.

 # *Prototype3* is the Java code for the visual front end. It is a NetBeans project and can't be (easily) used in Eclipse because of usage of NetBeans templates/libraries.
 # *TextAnalysisOverTweetsV2* is the Java code for processing the collected tweets. It is a Eclipse project and uses a few external libraries (see the 'lib' directory). The dataset available for download already contains the processing results, so you don't need to run this unless you want to re-process the data.

==Data==

Available in the 'Downloads' section.

There are more than 3 million tweets collected during the summer of 2011. Most of these are within the general London, UK area.

These are MySQL table dump. Due to the large size, the whole dataset is split into 5 files, which are compressed.

Below is the table schema:

|| *Column* || *Data type* ||
|| serial || int(11) ||
|| tweet_id || bigint(30) ||
|| username || varchar(40) ||
|| userid || int(11) || 
|| touser || varchar(40) ||
|| touserid || int(11) ||
